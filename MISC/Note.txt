I have attached, screen shot of my app which is based on shadcn + tanstack react table and styled by tailwind css.
The home page is a datagrid.
There are 2 screen shot of a json response - which is a log of changes for 1 of the line item record in datagrid.
data array property in response has log items for that record.

I want you to generate a component which list log items in a vertical line.
The line will have small circles... each of one log item.
Log item: (For now just use below 3 propertyies from log item )
  user_role - User role that made the change.
  action: The action the user performed (Status). Use a similar capsule used in datagrid (Status column)
  comments: Comments add by user.
